# Windows Unicode Console Error - FIXED âœ…

## The Problem

You got this error:
```
'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2192' in position 26: character maps to <undefined>
```

And a **500 Internal Server Error** when trying to translate.

## Root Cause

The arrow character `â†’` (Unicode U+2192) in the logging code cannot be displayed in Windows console, which uses `cp1252` encoding instead of UTF-8.

**This line caused the crash:**
```python
print(f"[TRANSLATE] Languages: {source_lang} â†’ {target_lang}")
```

**Why it worked in Google Colab:**
- Google Colab uses UTF-8 encoding (supports all Unicode characters)
- Windows console uses cp1252 encoding (limited character set)

## The Fix

Changed the Unicode arrow `â†’` to ASCII arrow `->`

**Before:**
```python
print(f"[TRANSLATE] Languages: {source_lang} â†’ {target_lang}")
```

**After:**
```python
print(f"[TRANSLATE] Languages: {source_lang} -> {target_lang}")
```

## Status

âœ… **FIXED** - Server restarted with the fix applied

## Try It Now

The server is already running with the fix. Try translating your file again!

1. Go to http://localhost:5000
2. Upload your Excel file
3. Select languages
4. Click "Translate File"
5. **Watch the terminal/console for progress updates**

You should now see:
```
[TRANSLATE] Starting translation: your_file.xlsx
[TRANSLATE] Languages: fr -> en
[TRANSLATE] Found 1 sheet(s) to process
[TRANSLATE] Processing sheet 1/1: 'Sheet1'
[TRANSLATE] Found X text cells in sheet 'Sheet1'
[TRANSLATE] Sheet 'Sheet1': 10/X cells processed (%)
...
[TRANSLATE] Translation complete!
```

## About the favicon.ico Error

The `404 (NOT FOUND)` for `/favicon.ico` is normal and harmless. Browsers automatically request a favicon (the little icon in the browser tab). You can ignore this error - it doesn't affect functionality.

**To fix it (optional):**
Add a favicon.ico file to your `static/` folder, but it's not necessary for the app to work.

**The translation should now work! Try it and let me know if you see the progress in the console!** ðŸš€
