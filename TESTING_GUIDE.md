## Test Structure

The test suite is organized into the following files:

```
tests/
├── test_unit.py              # Unit tests for core functions
├── test_integration.py       # API integration tests
├── test_edge_cases.py        # Edge cases and stress tests
├── test_performance.py       # Performance benchmarks
└── test_data_integrity.py    # Data integrity validation
```

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Generate Test Data

```bash
python generate_test_data.py
```

This creates 11 different test files covering various scenarios:
- Simple French text
- Formatted text with styling
- Multi-sheet workbooks
- Mixed content (text, numbers, formulas)
- Special characters and emojis
- Large files (1000x10 cells)
- Empty files
- Single cell files
- Old .xls format
- Merged cells
- Various languages

### 3. Create Test Results Directory

```bash
mkdir test_results
```

---

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Run Specific Test Categories

**Unit Tests Only:**
```bash
pytest tests/test_unit.py -v
```

**Integration Tests Only:**
```bash
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
```

**Edge Cases:**
```bash
pytest tests/test_edge_cases.py -v
```

**Performance Tests:**
```bash
pytest tests/test_performance.py -v -s
```

**Data Integrity Tests:**
```bash
pytest tests/test_data_integrity.py -v
```

### Run with Coverage Report

```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=excel_translator --cov-report=html
```

This generates an HTML coverage report in `htmlcov/index.html`.

### Run Performance Benchmarks

```bash
pytest tests/test_performance.py --benchmark-only
```

---

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (`test_unit.py`)

Tests individual functions in isolation.

**Key Tests:**
- ✅ Convert .xls to .xlsx
- ✅ Handle missing files
- ✅ Validate file formats
- ✅ Translate simple files
- ✅ Preserve formatting
- ✅ Handle multiple sheets
- ✅ Mixed content types
- ✅ Special characters
- ✅ Different language pairs

**What to Watch For:**
- All tests should pass without errors
- Translation API calls may be rate-limited
- Network errors should be handled gracefully

---

### 2. Integration Tests (`test_integration.py`)

Tests the Flask API endpoints.

**Key Tests:**
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Languages endpoint
- ✅ File upload and translation
- ✅ Different file formats (.xls, .xlsx)
- ✅ Custom language parameters
- ✅ Error handling (no file, empty filename)
- ✅ Multi-sheet files
- ✅ Large files
- ✅ Concurrent requests

**What to Watch For:**
- HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400/500 for errors)
- Response content types
- File downloads work correctly
- API handles errors gracefully

---

### 3. Edge Cases (`test_edge_cases.py`)

Tests unusual scenarios and boundary conditions.

**Key Tests:**
- ✅ Empty cells mixed with text
- ✅ Very long text (>5000 chars)
- ✅ All numeric content
- ✅ Formula preservation
- ✅ Merged cells
- ✅ Special characters (emojis, symbols)
- ✅ RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew)
- ✅ Mixed languages in one file
- ✅ Single row/column files
- ✅ Whitespace-only cells
- ✅ Numbers stored as text
- ✅ Very wide spreadsheets (100 columns)
- ✅ Many sheets (20 sheets)
- ✅ Complex formatting combinations

**What to Watch For:**
- No crashes or exceptions
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Data integrity maintained in all cases

---

### 4. Performance Tests (`test_performance.py`)

Benchmarks translation speed and resource usage.

**Key Tests:**
- ✅ Small file performance (10 cells)
- ✅ Medium file performance (100 cells)
- ✅ Large file performance (10,000 cells)
- ✅ Multi-sheet performance
- ✅ .xls conversion speed
- ✅ Batch processing
- ✅ Memory usage with large files
- ✅ Scalability (increasing rows/columns)

**What to Watch For:**
- Translation time should be reasonable (< 5 minutes for 10k cells)
- No memory errors with large files
- Linear (not exponential) scaling
- Consistent performance across runs

**Expected Performance Baselines:**
- Small files (10 cells): < 5 seconds
- Medium files (100 cells): < 30 seconds
- Large files (10,000 cells): < 5 minutes
- .xls conversion: < 2 seconds

---

### 5. Data Integrity Tests (`test_data_integrity.py`)

Validates that no data is lost or corrupted.

**Key Tests:**
- ✅ Cell count preserved
- ✅ Sheet count preserved
- ✅ Sheet names unchanged
- ✅ Numeric values unchanged
- ✅ Empty cells remain empty
- ✅ Font formatting preserved
- ✅ Cell colors preserved
- ✅ Alignment preserved
- ✅ Borders preserved
- ✅ .xls to .xlsx conversion integrity
- ✅ Row and column counts preserved

**What to Watch For:**
- All counts should match exactly
- Formatting attributes should be identical
- No data corruption or loss
- Type conversions handled correctly

```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Translation API Rate Limiting**
```
Error: Too many requests
```
**Solution:** Add delays between tests or use a translator API key with higher limits.

**Issue: Network Timeout**
```
Error: Request timeout
```
**Solution:** Increase timeout values or check network connectivity.

**Issue: Memory Error with Large Files**
```
MemoryError: Unable to allocate array
```
**Solution:** Process large files in chunks or increase available RAM.

**Issue: File Permission Error**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```
**Solution:** Ensure test_results directory has write permissions.

## Known Limitations

### 1. Translation Quality
- Google Translator may not be perfect for technical terms
- Context is lost (each cell translated independently)
- Some idioms may not translate well

### 2. Formatting Limitations
- Complex Excel features (macros, pivot tables) not supported
- Some advanced formatting may be lost
- Charts and images are not translated

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Very large files (>50,000 cells) may take significant time
- API rate limits may affect batch processing
- Network latency affects translation speed

### 4. File Format Support
- Only .xls and .xlsx formats supported
- Other formats (.csv, .ods) not supported

## Additional Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Scenarios

Test with real-world files:
1. Your actual customer files
2. Files with company-specific formatting
3. Files with domain-specific terminology
4. Files with mixed content types
5. Files from different Excel versions

### Load Testing

For production readiness:
```bash
# Use a tool like locust or artillery
# Example with locust:
locust -f locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:5000
```

### Security Testing

- Test file upload size limits
- Test with malicious file names
- Test with corrupted Excel files
- Test with zip bombs or large files
- Test concurrent uploads from same user
